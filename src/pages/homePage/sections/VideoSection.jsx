          The "brains" of your computer, the processor has a huge influence on
          performance, but depending on what you want to do, even the
          least-expensive model may be good enough

          Some laptops come with only 4GB of RAM, but ideally you want at least
          8GB on even a budget system and 16GB if you can spend just a little
          more. For 99% of users, 32GB isÂ more than enough, while 64GB and above
          is reserved for professional power users or high-end gamers.

          If you're not playing PC games, creating 3D objects or doing high-res
          video editing, an integrated graphics chip (one that shares system
          memory) will be fine, especially Intel's latest Iris Xe graphics. If
          you have any of the above needs, though, a discrete graphics processor
          from Nvidia or AMD is essential

          As important as the speed of your CPU is the performance of your
          storage drive. If you can afford it and don't need a ton of internal
          storage, get a laptop with a solid state drive (SSD) rather than a
          hard drive, because you'll see at least three times the speed and a
          much faster laptop overall
